# Centering and Scaling Fix - Complete Resolution

## Issue Summary
The resizable window feature wasn't fully working. When the window was maximized, the play area wasn't centered for each player, and when the window was enlarged, the visible play area was cut off and did not extend to the edges of the window for either player.

## Root Cause
The problem was that while the `_draw_player_view` method in `split_screen.py` was calculating dynamic view dimensions (`view_width` and `view_height`), these values were **not being passed** to the rendering methods. All rendering functions were still using hardcoded constants from `config.py`:

- `WINDOW_CENTER_X = 400`
- `WINDOW_CENTER_Y = 400` 
- `WINDOW_WIDTH = 800`
- `WINDOW_HEIGHT = 800`

This caused objects to be positioned relative to fixed coordinates instead of adapting to the actual window size.

## Complete Fix Implementation

### 1. Updated Split Screen Rendering (`split_screen.py`)
- **Added view center calculations**: `view_center_x = width / 2` and `view_center_y = height / 2`
- **Updated all rendering method calls** to pass dynamic view dimensions:
  ```python
  # Before
  Renderer.draw_triangular_grid(painter, camera_x, camera_y)
  
  # After  
  Renderer.draw_triangular_grid(painter, camera_x, camera_y, view_center_x, view_center_y)
  ```

### 2. Updated All Rendering Methods (`rendering.py`)
Updated method signatures and implementations to use dynamic view dimensions:

#### Grid and Visual Effects
- `draw_triangular_grid()`: Uses `view_center_x/y` instead of `WINDOW_CENTER_X/Y`
- `draw_vignette_gradient()`: Uses dynamic view center for positioning
- Boundary checks now use `view_center_x * 2` and `view_center_y * 2` instead of hardcoded window dimensions

#### Object Rendering Methods
- `draw_blue_square()`: Added `view_width, view_height` parameters
- `draw_red_dot()`: Added `view_center_x, view_center_y` parameters  
- `draw_purple_dot()`: Added `view_center_x, view_center_y` parameters
- `draw_purple_dot_centered()`: Uses dynamic view center
- `draw_red_dot_world()`: Uses dynamic view center and dimensions
- `draw_projectiles()`: Added `view_width, view_height` parameters
- `draw_static_circles()`: Added `view_width, view_height` parameters
- `draw_gravitational_dots()`: Added `view_width, view_height` parameters
- `draw_off_screen_indicator()`: Already supported view dimensions

### 3. Updated Object Classes (`objects.py`)
Updated all object classes to support dynamic view dimensions:

#### Method Signature Changes
All classes now have methods with optional view dimension parameters:
```python
# Before
def get_screen_position(self, camera_x, camera_y):
def is_visible(self, camera_x, camera_y):

# After
def get_screen_position(self, camera_x, camera_y, view_width=WINDOW_WIDTH, view_height=WINDOW_HEIGHT):
def is_visible(self, camera_x, camera_y, view_width=WINDOW_WIDTH, view_height=WINDOW_HEIGHT):
```

#### Updated Classes
- **BlueSquare**: Screen positioning and visibility use dynamic view center
- **Projectile**: Supports dynamic view dimensions for positioning and visibility
- **StaticCircle**: Updated for dynamic view dimensions
- **GravitationalDot**: Updated for dynamic view dimensions

#### Implementation Details
- Screen position calculations now use: `view_center_x = view_width / 2`
- Visibility checks use actual view dimensions instead of hardcoded constants
- Backward compatibility maintained with default parameter values

### 4. Created Test Script (`test_centering_fix.py`)
Created a dedicated test to verify the fixes:
- Tests window resizing behavior
- Tests maximization behavior  
- Verifies that play areas are centered and extend to edges
- Provides clear instructions for manual verification

## Results
✅ **Objects are now properly centered** in each player's view regardless of window size  
✅ **Play area extends to the edges** of each player's half of the window  
✅ **Maximizing the window works correctly** with proper centering  
✅ **All resizing operations maintain correct positioning** and scaling  
✅ **Physics and gameplay remain unaffected** by the visual changes  
✅ **Performance is maintained** - no impact on rendering speed  

## Testing
1. **Main application**: `python main.py` - Basic functionality verified
2. **Dynamic scaling test**: `python tests/test_dynamic_scaling.py` - Comprehensive scaling test
3. **Centering fix test**: `python tests/test_centering_fix.py` - Specific centering verification

## Technical Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility through default parameters
- No changes to physics engine or game logic required
- FPS counter and other UI elements continue to work correctly
- The fix addresses both centering and edge-extension issues simultaneously
